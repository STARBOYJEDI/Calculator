# Calculator App

## This application only uses HTML, CSS and inline javascript code.
### The project served as practice run for me to understand basic javascript syntax, proper styling with css alongside html.

## Application features:
- Standard calculator layout
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division button
- Clear (AC) and equals button

## The application can be ran on a web broswer by:
1. Clone the repository:
  - https://github.com/STARBOYJEDI/Calculator
2. Open 'index.html' in your browser

## What I learned from this personal project
- Handling User Input in JavaScript
- Relevant styling techniques in CSS
- Error Handling

## Challenges & Future Improvements to consider:
- Improve Error handling (division by zero)
- Implementing keyboard shortcurts for more functionality
